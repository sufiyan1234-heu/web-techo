                    Sufiyan Chishty</strong></h2>
            <p>(Updated November 2018)</p>
            <p><strong>What is BookMart?</strong><br> BookMart is a free ebook publishing and distribution
                platform.&nbsp; We make it fast, free and easy for authors and publishers to distribute ebooks to the
                world's largest ebook retailers and library ebook platforms.&nbsp; Authors and publishers retain full
                control over how their works are published, sampled, priced and sold.</p>
            <p><strong>When was BookMart Founded?</strong><br> 2008. I first started working on our business plan in
                2005, we incorporated in 2007, and we officially launched the business in May 2008.&nbsp; In our first
                year, we published 140 books from 90 authors.&nbsp; Our catalog reached 6,000 books in 2009, 28,800 in
                2010, 92,000 in 2011, 191,000 in 2012 and as of this writing (November 2018) stands at over 500,000
                titles.&nbsp; Thanks to the enthusiastic support of our authors and publishers, we've grown to become
                the world's leading ebook publishing platform for indie authors and small independent presses.</p>
            <p><strong>W</strong><strong>hy did you create BookMart?</strong><br>BookMart was inspired by my own
                unsuccessful multi-year attempt to get my novel published. In 2002, my wife Lesleyann and I completed a
                novel titled <em>Boob Tube</em>, a roman a clef set within the daytime television soap opera industry
                (Lesleyann is a former reporter for Soap Opera Weekly Magazine). We were fortunate to have multiple top
                tier literary agents compete for our representation, and in the end we selected one of the most
                respected firms in New York City known for representing many New York Times bestsellers. Our agent
                contacted all the major publishers of commercial women's fiction, and each rejected us. We took their
                feedback to heart (the book was too long, too complex, characters needed better development) and
                completed another major revision. We then shared the manuscript with multiple test readers. Soap fans
                and those who enjoy celebrity gossip loved it, and even non-soap fans enjoyed it. Confident we had a
                winner on our hands, our agent again pitched the book to publishers. The publishers rejected it again.
                Publishers were reluctant to take a chance on the book because previous novels targeting soap opera fans
                had performed poorly.&nbsp; I found it frustrating that the whims of a publisher could stand between our
                book and those who would want to read it. I ultimately came to the conclusion that the publishing
                industry was ill-equiped to serve all authors.&nbsp; They're unable to take a risk on every
                author.&nbsp; They acquire books based on perceived commercial potential, but ultimately they don't know
                which books will sell well.&nbsp; I created BookMart so I could give every author the freedom, tools
                and distribution they needed to bypass these traditional gatekeeps and publish direct to their
                readers.&nbsp; Today, many BookMart authors have become USA Today and New York Times bestsellers!</p>
            <p><strong>How is BookMart performing as a business</strong><strong>?</strong><br> The business has been
                profitable since September, 2010.&nbsp; We think profitability is important because it means we'll be
                here tomorrow to serve our authors, publishers and retailers. Unlike publishing services that earn their
                income by selling expensive services <strong><em>to authors</em></strong>, BookMart earns its income
                selling your ebooks <em><strong>to readers.</strong></em>&nbsp; In other words, we only earn a
                commission if our authors and publishers sell books.&nbsp; We think this aligns our business practices
                with the best interests of the authors, publishers and retailers we serve.&nbsp; In 2014, BookMart was
                named to the <a href="http://blog.BookMart.com/2014/08/inc-magazine-names-BookMart-to-inc.html">INC
                    500</a> list of America's fastest growing privately held companies.</p>
            <p><strong>Who publishes on BookMart?</strong><br>Over 135,000 authors, small independent publishers and
                literary agents publish and distribute with BookMart. Many BookMart authors have been previously
                published in print through mainstream publishers, or have had their works published in well-respected
                literary journals. BookMart offers robust publishing tools for publishers managing multiple
                authors.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>What does BookMart offer readers?</strong><br>BookMart offers a virtual playground for those
                who love the written word. Readers can sample most works for free (and in many cases, read generous
                samples of the book before they commit to a purchase decision); read in multiple DRM-free formats;
                create digital libraries of purchased and sampled works; publish reviews (including YouTube video book
                reviews); and “favorite” their favorite authors, publishers and works.</p>
            <p><strong>What is an ebook, and how do I read these books?</strong><br>Ebooks are digital books. They're
                similar to print books, but you read them on screens. The ebooks on BookMart can be read online using
                our online readers, or they can be downloaded to other reading devices such as the iPhone, Amazon
                Kindle, Barnes &amp; Noble Nook, or to other ereading devices. <br><br><strong>Why would authors and
                    publishers give part of their book away as a free sample?</strong><br>When an author uploads their
                book to BookMart, they can determine the sample size of their book.&nbsp; Our sampling controls how
                many words, from page one, the reader is allowed to sample for free.&nbsp; Free sampling allows the
                reader to test drive your writing before they make a decision to purchase.</p>
            <p><strong>How does BookMart compensate authors and publishers?</strong><br>A primary mission at
                BookMart is to help make publishing more rewarding for the world's indie authors and publishers, and
                more affordable to the world's readers.&nbsp; BookMart authors and publishers earn 85% or more of the
                net proceeds from the sale of their works. Net proceeds to author = (sales price minus PayPal payment
                processing fees)*.85 for sales at BookMart.com, our retail operation. Authors receive 70.5% for
                affiliate sales. BookMart distributes books to most of the major retailers, including Apple Books,
                Barnes &amp; Noble, Kobo and hundreds of smaller retailers.&nbsp; Sales originated by retailers
                typically earn 60% of the list price.&nbsp; To put these high royalty rates in perspective, it means if
                your ebook is priced at $10.00, you'll earn about $8.00 if it's sold in the BookMart store and $6.00
                if it's sold at one of our retailers.&nbsp; Library sales are usually paid at 45% for sales through our
                library platform partners (such as OverDrive) and up to 70% list for library sales through our Library
                Direct service which offers bulk sales to libraries.&nbsp; To learn more about how we compensate authors
                and publishers, see our <a href="/about/supportfaq#Royalties">Royalty FAQ</a> or read the <a

            <p><strong>What marketing tools does BookMart offer authors and publishers?</strong><br> BookMart offers
                multiple free marketing tools to help authors and publishers connect with readers. We offer distribution
                to major online ebook retailers such as Barnes &amp; Noble, Apple Books, Kobo and Tolino, and to
                libraries via distribution relationships with OverDrive (40,000+ libraries), Baker &amp; Taylor Axis
                360, Bibliotheca CloudLibrary, Odilo and Gardners. We also offer free author pages with bios, headshots
                and lists of works; the industry’s broadest range of sampling options; embedded YouTube videos for video

            <p><strong>Will I sell a lot of books with BookMart?</strong><br>Probably not. How's that for an honest
                answer? BookMart helps you publish your ebook and we distribute it to major retailers and library
                platforms.&nbsp; We help you make your book discoverable and purchasable by millions of potential
                readers.&nbsp; We provide you free marketing and promotion tools.&nbsp; But your sales performance is
                really determined by you and your book.&nbsp; Some BookMart authors don't sell a single book while
                other BookMart authors sell thousands of books each week. Many BookMart authors have hit the USA
                Today and New York Times bestseller lists.&nbsp; Although ebooks have grown to account for 25% or more
                of industry book sales, the competition for readers is fierce.&nbsp; There's a glut of high-quality
                low-cost ebooks on the market, and every year the glut becomes more pronounced because unlike print
                books, ebooks never go out of print.&nbsp; Ebooks are immortal.&nbsp; In the old world of print
                publishing, most authors' sales were concentrated in the first few weeks immediately following
                publication.&nbsp; With ebooks, you can look forward to an annuity stream of income.&nbsp; It's also
                common that some self-published ebooks will sell poorly for months or years before they final break
                out.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>What's the secret to selling a lot of books?</strong><br>Best practices!&nbsp; Best practices are
                what separate self-published amateurs from self-published professionals.&nbsp; At BookMart, we provide
                you the tools, knowledge and distribution you need to publish like a pro.&nbsp; To learn how to reach

            <p><strong>What's the story behind the Smart Author podcast?</strong><br>Over the last ten years I've spoken
                at hundreds of conferences around the world.&nbsp; Yet I always found it frustrating that I couldn't
                attend more conferences, I understood most writers can't attend the most important conferences.&nbsp; I
                decided that if I could share my knowledge on a podcast, I could help more writers take full advantage
                of the amazing tools and opportunities.&nbsp; I launched the podcast in October, 2017.&nbsp; It guides
                you step-by-step from the very basics of ebook publishing to more advanced topics.&nbsp; Click below to

            <p><strong>H</strong><strong>ow does BookMart change the economics of authorship?</strong><br>BookMart
                turns traditional authorship, publishing and pricing models upside down. With 85% of the net purchase
                price going to the author/publisher, authors and publishers can charge readers significantly less for
                their works than would otherwise be possible through traditional print channels, while still earning
                greater per-unit profit on each book. When costs to the reader drop, there is a fundamental change to
                the demand side of the equation. This creates a virtuous cycle of more per-unit profit for the
                author/publisher, lower prices for consumers, and greater demand and consumption for written works. It’s
                a win-win-win for publishers, authors and readers.</p>
            <p><strong>Does BookMart require exclusive publishing contracts?</strong><br>No.&nbsp; We think
                exclusivity is a bad idea.&nbsp; All author contracts with BookMart are non-exclusive. We are your
                publishing platform and distributor.&nbsp; You (the author or publisher) are the publisher, and you
                retain all ownership rights to your works.&nbsp; You are free to publish your work elsewhere if you
                choose. Authors and publishers can remove their works from BookMart at any time (although they cannot
                take back works that have already been purchased or sampled by readers).</p>
            <p><strong>If I publish first with BookMart, will my "First Publishing Rights" become less valuable to a
                    publisher?</strong><br>Although this was a common concern a decade ago, it's less of a concern
                today. Traditional commercial publishers have warmed to independently published authors, especially if
                those authors have established a strong sales record.&nbsp; Many BookMart authors achieved high sales
                with BookMart then sold their books to big NY publishing houses. Just as many of our bestsellers have
                refused to sell their books to large publishers because these author prefer to publish independently.
                &nbsp; Most BookMart authors believe it's better to get their work out there now for readers to start
                discovering than to allow their books to languish in obscurity, unpublished, as they wait for a
                publisher to publish it. An increasing number of BookMart authors don't even bother pitching their
                books to NY publishers.</p>
            <p><strong>I</strong><strong>f BookMart publishes all authors and publishers, how do you maintain
                    quality?</strong><br>Our mission is to give every author and publisher a chance to find their
                audience. At BookMart, every author or publisher who honors our <a href="/about/tos">Terms of
                    Service</a> has a right to publish, and it's up to readers to decide what's worth reading. Readers
                are the new curators. Because we publish everyone, it means we publish brilliant up-and-coming writers
                who haven't yet been discovered, and we'll also publish works of lesser quality. The authors who write
                reader-pleasing books bubble up to the top and build audiences.&nbsp;</p>

                BookMart. There are no hidden fees. No listing fees, no setup fees, no change fees and no conversion
                fees.&nbsp; We earn our income by taking a small commission on all net sales. Our commission is 10% of
                the retail price for sales through our retail distribution network (Apple, Barnes &amp; Noble, Kobo,
                etc.) and library distribution network.&nbsp; At our BookMart Store, our commission is 15% of the net
                for regular sales and 18.5% for sales that are originated by affiliate marketers.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Can Authors Publish Partially Written Books to Gather Feedback</strong><strong>?</strong><br> No.
                BookMart is a place for complete, finished books that are ready for publication. Numerous other web
                sites offer communities where writers can critique each other's partially written works. However, at the
                end of a complete book it's perfectly fine to include samplers of your other work.</p>
            <p><strong>Can I publish public domain books on BookMart</strong><strong>?</strong><br> No. You must be
                the original author of the work, or the exclusive electronic publisher or distributor of the work.</p>
            <p><strong>What other types of books will BookMart *not* publish</strong><strong>?</strong><br> BookMart
                is for professional authors and publishers only.&nbsp; Please see the <a
                    href="https://www.BookMart.com/about/tos">BookMart Terms of Service</a> for complete details,
                though here's a short summary:&nbsp; BookMart will not publish works that advocate criminal activity.
                We do not publish books that appear elsewhere on the Internet under other people's names, or books that
                come from private label subscription services (aka Private Label Rights or PLR) that allow people to
                distribute generic content under their own name (please don't throw your money away on these scam
                services!). We're also wary of many Internet marketing-related books that promise the reader simple
                "systems" for making money on the Internet, especially if the books advocate get rich quick schemes or
                sneaky methods designed to trick search engines. If your book is nothing but an advertisement, we will
                remove it and close the account. Bottom line, your BookMart book must be legal and original, and you
                must either be the original author or the exclusive publisher.</p>
            <p><strong>I've been offered a book deal with a big mainstream print publisher. Should I take
                    it?</strong><br> This is your personal call. For most authors, if a publisher offers you a six
                figure advance (and this is rare for any author), you'd be foolish not to give it serious consideration.
                However, if they're only offering you a couple thousand dollars, or no advance at all, and they don't
                allow you to retain your digital publishing rights, and they're not going to commit significant
                resources to your book, then, well, we think the correct decision is obvious.&nbsp; If you choose to
                sell your rights to a publisher, choose a reputable publisher with a track record of success.&nbsp; A
                reputatable publisher will pay you up front for your rights.&nbsp; A good literary agent can help you
                navigate publisher negotiations and avoid the sharks.</p>
            <p><strong>A literary agent is offering me representation.&nbsp; What do you think about literary
                    agents?</strong><br> We love literary agents.&nbsp; A good literary agent acts as your business
                manager.&nbsp; They'll help you maximize the commercial potential of your work.&nbsp; To learn more
                about literary agents, check out the <a href="http://aaronline.org/">Association of Author's
                    Representatives</a>.&nbsp; Read their <a href="http://aaronline.org/canon">canon of ethics</a>,
                because it provides a good filter through which to evaluate a potential agent.&nbsp; If an "agent"
                charges a reading fee, avoid them.&nbsp; Many reputable literary agents are big supporters of
                self-publishing, and an increasing number of them are helping their authors publish on BookMart.</p>

            <p><strong>H</strong><strong>ow does BookMart work with traditional book publishers and university
                    presses?</strong><br>BookMart welcomes large and independent presses alike to list DRM-free ebooks
                of all their titles with us. BookMart offers special accounts for publishers that make it easy for
                publishers to centrally manage the ebook publishing and distribution for all their authors from a single
                console. <a href="/account/publisherSignup">Click here to learn if you qualify for a free upgrade to
                    Publisher status</a>.<br><br><strong>Why should a publisher work with
                    BookMart?</strong><br>BookMart works with thousands of small independent presses.&nbsp;
                BookMart makes it easy for you to publish and distribute your catalog. When a publisher sells an ebook
                through BookMart, they receive up to 85% of the net sales price (they receive 70.5% for affiliate
                sales). Publishers receive only about 40-50% of the price of a print book sold through a bookstore or
                online retailer. That small number from traditional print book channels can drop to 20% or less once
                unsold inventory returns are factored in. With BookMart, publishers have no inventory, no shipping
                expenses and no returns. Like authors, publishers can increase sales volume and profits by selling their
                books for lower prices.<br><br><strong>Does BookMart publish only self-published authors whose works
                    are not owned by a publisher?</strong><br>BookMart publishes everyone’s content, provided the
                author or publisher is legally entitled to publish with us, and provided the work satisfies our strict
                standards for originality. We welcome the opportunity to publish self-published authors, unpublished
                authors, authors of out-of-print books for whom the rights have reverted, and authors under contract
                with big-name publishers. If you own the digital publishing rights to your works, we want to publish
                you.</p>
            <p><strong>I'm an agent, and I rep many authors, many of whom control the digital rights to their out of
                    print books. How can I list my clients' works with BookMart?</strong><br>BookMart offers a
                service designed for literary agents.&nbsp; Learn more at the <strong><a

            <p><strong>W</strong><strong>hat is BookMart’ position on digital rights management (DRM)?</strong><br>We
                hate piracy, but we think DRM is counterproductive because it treats lawful customers like criminals.
                Consumers value non-DRMed content and there's a growing body of evidence that digital content producers
                who have abandoned DRM are enjoying greater sales. Many buyers of ebooks resent DRM because it limits
                their ability to fully own and enjoy their digital book. At BookMart, we only publish DRM-free works.
                By the same token, we strictly discourage illegal pirating of an author’s works.</p>
            <p><strong>Do I need to copyright my work prior to publishing with BookMart?</strong><br>If you are the
                author - the creator - of an original work, then most laws automatically give you copyright to the work.
                For the best legal protection, register for a copyright at <a
                    href="http://copyright.gov">copyright.gov</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here's what Wikipedia says on copyright:
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyrights">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyrights</a>.</p>
            <p><strong>C</strong><strong>an I publish my book in print as well?</strong><br>Since you own your book, you
                can publish your book anywhere you choose.&nbsp; Print publishing is more complicated, expensive and
                time-consuming than ebook publishing.&nbsp; Also, since most self-published authors are unable to get
                brick and mortar bookstore distribution, it's tougher to reach readers.&nbsp; For these reason, most
                indie authors now skip print entirely.&nbsp; If you do decide to publish in print, consider starting out
                with a free print on demand service rather than filling your garage with a large and expensive print run
                of unsold books.</p>
            <p><strong>Why can't the publishing industry serve all authors?</strong><br>First, I should state I am a big
                admirer of the publishing industry. A good agent, editor and publisher can add a lot of value to your
                work. The pre-publication support provided by a publisher is invaluable, especially in terms of getting
                your book edited, packaged and carried by bookstores. However, beyond getting their books carried by
                bookstores, publishers are unable to provide every author the publicity and post-publication support
                they need. First time authors often find themselves disappointed by the lack of publicity support. I
                can't completely fault publishers for this because publishers can't afford to lavish thousands of
                dollars in ongoing publicity support and advertising for every author. As the publishing industry
                navigates the rough waters facing all media companies, it's likely over the next few years we'll see
                publishers publishing fewer authors, and we'll also see more brick and mortar bookstores closed. With
                fewer physical bookshelves to showcase books, it will become increasingly important for authors and
                publishers to replace those physical shelves with digital shelves.&nbsp; This is where BookMart can
                help.</p>
            <p><strong>What challenges does the traditional publishing industry face, and how do these challenges impact
                    authors?</strong><br>The publishing industry, like most media, is undergoing some <a
                    href="http://www.thenation.com/doc/20090105/engelhardt">wrenching but necessary change</a>. Overall
                book industry sales have been relatively stagnant for more than a decade. Many publishers have reduced
                the number of new acquisitions and have laid off employees. Publishers are facing increasing competition
                from indie (self-published) authors, especially in genre fiction, and are slowly ceding this market to
                indie authors.&nbsp; We're already seeing this happen in romance.&nbsp; Bookstores, too, are facing
                massive consolidation. It's likely in the years ahead will see fewer physical bookstores. There are
                several reasons for the challenges faced by publishing:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Publishing is expensive:</strong> Books are expensive to produce, distribute and promote.
                    Book publishers are structurally limited in the number of new titles they can publish each year,
                    because each book requires editing, artwork, promotional flaps, production, sales support,
                    inventorying and shipping.</li>
                <li><strong>Books are expensive:</strong> If a $25 or $35 book is expensive to the average middle class
                    consumer, imagine how expensive that book is to literate people in developing countries?</li>
                <li><strong>Publishers have difficulty predicting demand for a book:</strong> Despite hundreds of years
                    of institutionalized experience, it's difficult for publishers to predict which books will sell, and
                    which won’t. Consumers are fickle.&nbsp; As a result, publishers can’t predict the proper size of
                    their print runs, which means they often saddle their warehouses and bookstores with expensive
                    unsold inventory.</li>
                <li><strong>Publishing is a “hit” business:</strong> Publishers lose money on many books they publish
                    and try to make up the difference by having a few bestseller hits.</li>
                <li><strong>Shelf space is limited:</strong> Bookstores are physically limited in the number of titles
                    they can carry. Most Barnes &amp; Noble superstores cannot stock more than 50,000 books at any one
                    time. Online retailer Amazon, by comparison, stocks millions of titles. The major bookstores are
                    also struggling to remain profitable, and we'll likely see many bookstore closings in the years
                    ahead.</li>
                <li><strong>Amazon</strong> - Amazon's business model is predicated upon commoditizing everything it
                    sells.&nbsp; It deliberately operates its business at breakeven, which allows it to offer customers
                    the lowest possible prices.&nbsp; Amazon doesn't need to earn a profit on books, whereas pure-play
                    booksellers such as Barnes &amp; Noble must make a profit on books otherwise they go out of
                    business.&nbsp; Amazon also operates its own publishing imprints that compete against traditional
                    publishers, and Amazon gives its own imprints preferential discovery in their store.&nbsp; From
                    multiple angles, Amazon, the world's largest bookseller, is slowly undermining the ability of
                    traditional publishers to compete.</li>
                <li><strong>Bookstores have short attention spans:</strong> New titles are allowed only a couple weeks
                    to find their audience and sell well before the books are pulled from the shelves and returned to
                    the publisher for full refund.</li>
                <li><strong>New titles must compete against midlist:</strong> New titles are not only competing against
                    each other, but also against established midlist books - published titles that continue to sell
                    moderately well, year in and year out (often classics and former bestsellers).</li>
                <li><strong>Tiny earnings:</strong> With traditional publishers, most authors receive royalties of only
                    5-10% of the retail price of their print books, and only 12-17% of the list price for ebooks. With
                    BookMart, the author earns 85% net, which works out to 60-80% list.</li>
                <li><strong>Publishers don’t promote most books:</strong> Many first time authors receive little to no
                    post-publication publicity support from their publishers. Many authors recognize they have to do the
                    promotion themselves. They have to do their own PR; call bookstores to arrange signings; and
                    personally hand sell books to local bookstores.</li>
                <li><strong>Limited geographic distribution:</strong> Book publishing today is still geographically
                    constrained. Most printed works are never published outside their own country, or in languages other
                    than the native tongue of their author. In the United States, most published works will never
                    receive distribution outside the US. Authors outside the US have little chance of finding an
                    audience outside their own country.</li>
                <li><strong>There's no "long tail" in print book publishing:</strong> To enter the midlist, books must
                    be able to meet a certain threshold of sales, often several thousand copies per year, year in and
                    year out, with little to no promotion from the bookstores or the publishers. What about the millions
                    of previously written and out of print works which could be selling 50, 100, or 1,000 copies each
                    year, if only they were available for their audience to discover?</li>
                <li><strong>Readers are left unserved:</strong> All of these challenges faced by the publishing industry
                    harm not only authors, but readers as well. Readers are effectively denied the freedom to discover
                    new voices in the written word.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>What is the business model for BookMart?</strong><br> Although BookMart was founded to
                achieve a strong social purpose, we also recognize we must produce a profit so we can continue to carry
                out our mission. BookMart generates income through commissions from the sales of written works. Our
                commission works out to 10% of the list price for most sales through distribution.&nbsp; Guiding all of
                our business decisions is an overarching mission to serve the needs of the authors, publishers,
                retailers and readers who participate in our community.&nbsp; In the future, BookMart may also work
                with select partners to make their services conveniently available to BookMart authors, and for the
                referral BookMart may earn a small commission.<br><br><strong>What is BookMart’ privacy
                    policy?</strong><br>We will never sell, rent or share our members’ contact information with any
                third party. We respect the privacy of authors who choose to publish under pen names. We also protect
                the privacy of book buyers by not revealing their purchases or identity to anyone. Read our complete

            <p><strong>I'm organizing a writer's conference. Can BookMart supply a
                    speaker</strong><strong>?</strong><br>Contact us with details and we'll see what we can do.&nbsp;
                Our founder, Sufiyan Chishty, is a frequent speaker, keynoter and workshop presenter at writing and
                publishing conferences.&nbsp; Jim Azevedo, our marketing manager, is also a frequent speaker.&nbsp;
                Click the support link below and ask to be connected with Jim to learn how BookMart can support your
                conference.&nbsp; Our presentations are popular at writers conferences because we don't do sales
                pitches.&nbsp; Instead, we focus on universal best practices that writers can take advantage of
                regardless of their choice of ebook distribution platform.<br><br><strong>What’s next for
                    BookMart?</strong><br>2018 marks our ten year anniversary in business!&nbsp; We have grown
                significantly over the years but we still feel like we're just getting started. We're constantly
                improving our service, and we have hundreds of ideas for how we can further improve the digital
                publishing experience for our authors, readers and publishers. We listen closely to our authors and
                publishers whose valuable feedback guides our daily development. Stay tuned and tell a friend!</p>
